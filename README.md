# Face Mask Detection
# Overview
# The Face Mask Detection project is aimed at detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. It employs computer vision techniques to analyze images or video streams and classify individuals into two categories: wearing a mask and not wearing a mask. This project can be useful in various applications, such as monitoring compliance with face mask regulations in public spaces, enhancing safety and security measures in healthcare facilities, and more.
